# MDT

## Environment

Even though this is container, I still want to say **It works on my environment.** :)

## How To Use?

1. Use git clone to copy this project on your own laptop
2. cd this folder
3. Excute cmd `docker-compose up -d`
4. Open Grafana UI with  http://localhost:3000, or change the "localhost" to your own specific IP address
5. The datastore is already been added, so, you can begin to configure the Grafana Dashboard directly



## Configuration on IOS-XR

TBD
